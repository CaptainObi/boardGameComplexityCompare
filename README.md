## Running the code

I will dockerize this project sometime. For now run the following commands

`npm i`
`cd client`
`npm i`
`npm run start`

Open a new window
`npm run dev`


You then want a mysql instace running with two databases with the schemas of `games` and `compare`. Adjust the settings to connect to the db at /src/config/config.ts
